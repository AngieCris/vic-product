As a container developer, you can deploy, test, and run container processes in the same way as you would normally perform container operations. \nThe information in this topic is intended for container developers. For an extended version of this information, see Overview of vSphere Integrated Containers Engine for vSphere Administrators in vSphere Integrated Containers Engine Installation. \nDifferences Between vSphere Integrated Containers Engine and a Classic Container Environment\nThe main differences between vSphere Integrated Containers Engine and a classic container environment are the following:\n\nvSphere, not Linux, is the container host:\nContainers are spun up as VMs, not in VMs.\nEvery container is fully isolated from the host and from the other containers.\nvSphere provides per-tenant dynamic resource limits within a vCenter Server cluster\n\n\nvSphere, not Linux, is the infrastructure:\nYou can select vSphere networks that appear in the Docker client as container networks.\nImages, volumes, and container state are provisioned directly to VMFS.\n\n\nvSphere is the control plane:\nUse the Docker client to directly control selected elements of vSphere infrastructure.\nA container endpoint Service-as-a-Service presents as a service abstraction, not as IaaS\n\n\n\nWhat Does vSphere Integrated Containers Engine Do?\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine allows the vSphere administrator to easily make the vSphere infrastructure accessible to you, the container application developer, so that you can provision container workloads into production.\nScenario 1: A Classic Container Environment\nIn a classic container environment: \n\nYou raise a ticket and say, \"I need Docker\". \nThe vSphere administrator provisions a large Linux VM and sends you the IP address.\nYou install Docker, patch the OS, configure in-guest network and storage virtualization, secure the guest, isolate the containers, package the containers efficiently, and manage upgrades and downtime. \n\nIn this scenario, what the vSphere administrator has given you is similar to a nested hypervisor that you have to manage and which is opaque to them.\nScenario 2: vSphere Integrated Containers Engine\nWith vSphere Integrated Containers Engine: \n\nYou raise a ticket and say, \"I need Docker\". \nThe vSphere administrator identifies datastores, networking, and compute on a cluster that you can use in your Docker environment. \nThe vSphere administrator uses a utility called vic-machine to install a small appliance. The appliance represents an authorization for you to use the infrastructure that the vSphere administrator has identified, into which you can self-provision container workloads.\nThe appliance runs a secure remote Docker API, that is the only access that you have to the vSphere infrastructure.\nInstead of sending you a Linux VM, the vSphere administrator sends you the IP address of the appliance, the port of the remote Docker API, and a certificate for secure access.\n\nIn this scenario, the vSphere administrator has provided you with a service portal. This is better for you because you do not have to worry about isolation, patching, security, backup, and so on. It is better for the vSphere administrator because every container that you deploy is a container VM, that they can manage just like all of their other VMs.\nIf you discover that you need more compute capacity, in Scenario 1, the vSphere administrator has to power down the VM and reconfigure it, or give you a new VM and let you deal with the clustering implications. Both of these solutions are disruptive to you. With vSphere Integrated Containers Engine in Scenario 2, the vSphere administrator can reconfigure the VCH in vSphere, or redeploy it with a new configuration in a way that is completely transparent to you.\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine Concepts\nThe objective of vSphere Integrated Containers Engine is to take as much of vSphere as possible and layer whatever Docker capabilities are missing on top, reusing as much of Docker’s own code as possible. The  result should not sacrifice the portability of the Docker image format and should be completely transparent to a Docker client. The following sections describe key concepts and components that make this possible.\nContainer VMs\nThe container VMs that vSphere Integrated Containers Engine creates have all of the characteristics of software containers:\n\nAn ephemeral storage layer with optionally attached persistent volumes.\nA custom Linux guest OS that is designed to be \"just a kernel\" and that needs images to be functional.\nA mechanism for persisting and attaching read-only binary image layers.\nA PID 1 guest agent tether extends the control plane into the container VM.\nVarious well-defined methods of configuration and state ingress and egress\nAutomatically configured to various network topologies.\n\nThe provisioned container VM does not contain any OS container abstraction. \n\nThe container VM boots from an ISO that contains the Photon Linux kernel. Note that container VMs do not run the full Photon OS.\nThe container VM is configured with a container image that is mounted as a disk. \nContainer image layers are represented as a read-only VMDK snapshot hierarchy on a vSphere datastore. At the top of this hierarchy is a read-write snapshot that stores ephemeral state. \nContainer volumes are formatted VMDKs that are attached as disks and indexed on a datastore. \nNetworks are distributed port groups that are attached as vNICs.\n\n\nVirtual Container Hosts\nA virtual container host (VCH) is the functional equivalent of a Linux VM that runs Docker, but with some significant benefits. A VCH represents the following elements:\n\nA clustered pool of resource into which to provision container VMs.\nA single-tenant container namespace.\nA secure API endpoint. \nAuthorization to use and configure pre-approved virtual infrastructure.\n\nA VCH is functionally distinct from a traditional container host in the following ways:\n\nIt naturally encapsulates clustering and dynamic scheduling by provisioning to vSphere targets.\nThe resource constraints are dynamically configurable with no impact on the containers.\nContainers do not share a kernel.\nThere is no local image cache. This is kept on a datastore in the cluster that the vSphere administrator specified when they deployed a VCH.\nThere is no read-write shared storage\n\n"},"container_operations.html":{"url":"container_operations.html","title":"Supported Docker Commands","keywords":"","body":"Supported Docker Commands\n vSphere Integrated Containers Engine 0.8 supports Docker 1.11.2.

The IP address can either be static or be obtained from DHCP. As a container developer, you require the IP address of the VCH endpoint VM when you run Docker commands. \nDepending on the nature of your organization, you might deploy VCHs yourself, or you might request a VCH from a different person or team. If you do not run vic-machine create yourself, your organization must define the process by which you obtain VCH addresses. This process can be as simple as an exchange of emails with a vSphere administrator, or as advanced as a custom self-provisioning portal or API end-point. For example, your organization could use VMware vRealize® Automation™ to provide a self-provisioning service, by using the vRealize Automation interface or APIs to request VCHs. At the end of the provisioning process, vRealize Automation would communicate the VCH endpoint VM address to you.\nUsing Docker Environment Variables\nIf you or the vSphere administrator deploy VCHs with TLS authentication, vic-machine create generates a file named vch_address.env. The env file contains Docker environment variables that are specific to the VCH. You can use the contents of the env file to set environment variables in your Docker client. A self-provisioning service such as vRealize Automation could potentially provide the env file at the end of the provisioning process for VCHs.\nConnecting to the VCH\nHow you connect to your VCH depends on the security options with which  you or the vSphere administrator deployed the VCH. \n\nIf the VCH uses TLS authentication, either by using server certificates or by using mutual authentication with client and server certificates, you connect to the VCH at vch_address:2376.  \nIf the VCH uses mutual authentication with client and server certificates, you must configure the Docker client appropriately with one of the following options:\nBy using the following --tlsverify, --tlscert, and --tlskey Docker options, adding tlscacert if a custom CA was used to sign the server certificate.\nBy setting DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/path/to/client/cert.pem and DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1.\n\n\nIf the VCH uses server certificates without client authentication, you run Docker commands with the --tls option. The DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY environment variable must not be set. Note that setting DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY to 0 or false has no effect. \nIf TLS is completely disabled on the VCH, you connect to the VCH at vch_address:2375 and do not need to specify any additional Docker options. \n\n"},"using_volumes_with_vic.html":{"url":"using_volumes_with_vic.html","title":"Using Volumes with vSphere Integrated Containers Engine","keywords":"","body":"Using Volumes with vSphere Integrated Containers Engine\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine supports the use of container volumes. \nIMPORTANT: To use container volume capabilities with vSphere Integrated Containers Engine, you or the vSphere administrator must configure the virtual container host (VCH) appropriately at the moment of deployment of the VCH. When you create or the vSphere administrator creates a VCH, you or the administrator must specify the datastore to use to store container volumes in the vic-machine create --volume-store option. You cannot currently add volume stores, and therefore volume capabilities, to a VCH after its initial deployment. For information about how to use the vic-machine create --volume-store option, see the section on volume-store in VCH Deployment Options in vSphere Integrated Containers Engine Installation.  \n\nObtain the List of Available Volume Stores \nObtain the List of Available Volumes\nCreate a Volume in a Volume Store\nCreating Volumes from Images\nCreate a Container with a New Anonymous or Named Volume\nMount an Existing Volume on a Container\nObtain Information About a Volume \nDelete a Named Volume from a Volume Store \n\nFor simplicity, the examples in this topic assume that the VCHs implement TLS authentication with self-signed untrusted certificates, with no client verification.\n\nObtain the List of Available Volume Stores\nTo obtain the list of volume stores that are available on a VCH, run docker info.\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls info\n\nThe list of available volume stores for this VCH appears in the docker info output under VolumeStores.\n[...]\nStorage Driver: vSphere Integrated Containers Backend Engine\nVolumeStores: volume_store_1 volume_store_2 ... volume_store_n\nvSphere Integrated Containers Backend Engine: RUNNING\n[...]\n\n\nObtain the List of Available Volumes\nTo obtain a list of volumes that are available on a VCH, run docker volume ls.\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls volume ls\n\nDRIVER         VOLUME NAME\nvsphere        volume_1\nvsphere        volume_2\n[...]          [...]\nvsphere        volume_n\n\n\nCreate a Volume in a Volume Store\nWhen you use the docker volume create command to create a volume, you can optionally provide a name for the volume by specifying the --name option. If you do not specify --name, docker volume create assigns a random UUID to the volume.\n\nIf you or the vSphere administrator created the VCH with one or more volume stores, but none of the volume stores are named default, you must specify the name of an existing volume store in the --opt VolumeStore option. If you do not specify --opt VolumeStore, docker volume create searches for a volume store named default, and returns an error if no such volume store exists. \ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls volume create \n--opt VolumeStore=volume_store_label \n--name volume_name\n\nIf you or the vSphere administrator created the VCH with a volume store named default, you do not need to specify --opt VolumeStore in the docker volume create command. If you do not specify a volume store name, the docker volume create command automatically uses the default volume store if it exists.\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls volume create \n--name volume_name\n\nYou can optionally set the capacity of a volume by specifying the --opt Capacity option when you run docker volume create. If you do not specify the --opt Capacity option, the volume is created with the default capacity of 1024MB. \nIf you do not specify a unit for the capacity, the default unit will be in Megabytes.\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls volume create \n--opt VolumeStore=volume_store_label \n--opt Capacity=2048\n--name volume_name\nTo create a volume with a capacity in megabytes, gigabytes, or terabytes, include MB, GB, or TB in the value that you pass to --opt Capacity. The unit is case insensitive.\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls volume create \n--opt VolumeStore=volume_store_label \n--opt Capacity=10GB\n--name volume_name\n\n\n\nAfter you create a volume by using docker volume create, you can mount that volume in a container by running either of the following commands:\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls \ncreate -v volume_name:/folder busybox\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls \nrun -v volume_name:/folder busybox\n\nIn the examples above, Docker mounts the volume volume_name to /folder in the container.\nNOTE: When using a vSphere Integrated Containers Engine VCH as your Docker endpoint, the storage driver is always the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine Backend Engine. If you specify the docker volume create --driver option an error stating that a bad driver has been selected will occur.\n\nCreating Volumes from Images\nSome images, for example, mongo or redis:alpine, contain volume bind information in their metadata. vSphere Integrated Containers Engine creates such volumes with the default parameters and treats them as anonymous volumes. vSphere Integrated Containers Engine treats all volume mount paths as unique, in the same way that Docker does. This should be kept in mind if you attempt to bind other volumes to the same location as anonymous or image volumes. A specified volume always takes priority over an anonymous volume.\nIf you require an image volume with a different volume capacity to the default, create a named volume with the required capacity. You can mount that named volume to the location that the image metadata specifies. You can find the location by running docker inspect image_name and consulting the Volumes section of the output. The resulting container has the required storage capacity and the endpoint.  \n\nCreate a Container with a New Anonymous or Named Volume\nIf you intend to create named or anonymous volumes by using docker create -v when creating containers, a volume store named default must exist in the VCH. \nNOTES: \n\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine does not support mounting folders as data volumes. A command such as docker create -v /folder_name:/folder_name busybox is not supported.\nIf you use docker create -v to create containers and mount new volumes on them, vSphere Integrated Containers Engine only supports the -r and -rw options.\n\nCreate a Container with a New Anonymous Volume\nTo create an anonymous volume, you include the path to the destination at which you want to mount the anonymous volume in the docker create -v command. Docker creates the anonymous volume in the default volume store, if it exists. The VCH mounts the anonymous volume on the container.\nThe docker create -v example below performs the following actions:\n\nCreates a busybox container that uses an anonymous volume in the default volume store.\nMounts the volume to /volumes in the container.\n\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls \ncreate -v /volumes busybox\n\nCreate a Container with a Named Volume\nTo create a container with a new named volume, you specify a volume name in the docker create -v command. When you create containers that with named volumes, the VCH checks whether the volume exists in the volume store, and if it does not, creates it. The VCH mounts the existing or new volume on the container.\nThe docker create -v example below performs the following actions:\n\nCreates a busybox container\nCreates volume named volume_1 in the default volume store.\nMounts the volume to the /volumes folder in the container.\n\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls \ncreate -v volume_1:/volumes busybox\n\n\nMount an Existing Volume on a Container\nMounting existing volumes on containers is subject to the following limitations:\n\nvSphere Integrated Containers Engine currently supports mounting a volume on only one container at a time. \nDocker does not support unmounting a volume from a container, whether that container is running or not. When you mount a volume on a container by using docker create -v,  that volume remains mounted on the container until you remove the container. When you have removed the container you can mount the volume onto a new container.\nIf you intend to create and mount a volume on one container, remove that container, and then mount the same volume on another container, use a named volume. It is possible to mount an anonymous volume on one container, remove that container, and then mount the anonymous volume on another container, but it is not recommended to do so.\n\nThe docker create -v example below performs the following operations:\n\nCreates a container named container1 from the busybox image.\nMounts the named volume volume1 to the myData folder on that container, starts the container, and attaches to it.\nAfter performing operations in volume1:/myData, stops and removes container1.\nCreates a container named container2 from the Ubuntu image.\nMounts volume1 to the myData folder on container2.\n\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls \ncreate --name container1 -v volume1:/myData busybox\ndocker start container1\ndocker attach container1 \n\n[Perform container operations and detach]\n\ndocker stop container1 \ndocker rm container1\ndocker create -it --name container2 -v volume1:/myData ubuntu\ndocker start container2 \ndocker attach container2 \n\n[Perform container operations with the same volume that was \npreviously mounted to container1]\n\n\nObtain Information About a Volume\nTo get information about a volume, run docker volume inspect and specify the name of the volume.\ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls \nvolume inspect volume_name\n\n\nDelete a Named Volume from a Volume Store\nTo delete a volume, run docker volume rm and specify the name of the volume to delete. \ndocker -H virtual_container_host_address:2376 --tls \nvolume rm volume_name\n\nNOTE: vSphere Integrated Containers does not support running docker rm -v to remove volumes that are associated with a container.\n"},"using_registries_with_vic.html":{"url":"using_registries_with_vic.html","title":"Using Private Registry Servers with vSphere Integrated Containers Engine","keywords":"","body":"Using Private Registry Servers with vSphere Integrated Containers Engine\nIf your development environment includes private registry servers for container images, you or the vSphere administrator must correctly configure virtual container hosts (VCHs) to allow them to connect to the private registry servers.\nYou can use vSphere Integrated Containers Engine with either secure or insecure private registry servers.\nSecure Private Registry Servers\nIf the private registry server is configured with TLS, the VCH must be able to validate the registry's certificate. If the registry's server certificate was signed by a custom CA, you must provide that CA to the VCH by using the --registry-ca option. If the registry server has a certificate signed by a public CA then it should function without any additional configuration.\nFor information about how to configure a VCH to use private registry server CA certificates, see the section on --registry-ca in VCH Deployment Options in vSphere Integrated Containers Engine Installation. \nInsecure Private Registry Servers\nIf you set up a private registry that does not use certificates, you or the vSphere administrator must deploy the VCH with the vic-machine create --insecure-registry option. Setting the insecure-registry option on a VCH informs that VCH that it is authorized to pull images from the designated insecure private registry server.\nIf you authorize a VCH to connect to an insecure private registry server, the VCH attempts to access the registry server via HTTP if access via HTTPS fails. VCHs always use HTTPS when connecting to registry servers for which you have not authorized insecure access. Insecure private registries are not recommended in production environments.\nFor information about how to use the vic-machine create --insecure-registry option, see the section on insecure-registry in VCH Deployment Options in vSphere Integrated Containers Engine Installation. \nPull a Container Image from a Private Registry Server\nTo pull a container image from a private registry server, run the following Docker command. \ndocker -H vch_address:2376 --tls \npull registry_server_address/path/to/image/image_name:image_version\n\nIf the private registry server listens for connections on a specific port, include the port number in the registry server URL.\ndocker -H vch_address:2376 --tls \npull registry_server_address:port_number/path/to/image/image_name:image_version\n\nThese commands will only work in the following circumstances:\n\nThe private registry server at registry_server_address is secured by CA certificates, and you or the vSphere administrator passed the appropriate certificates to the VCH during deployment by using the --registry-ca option.\nThe private registry server at registry_server_address is not secured by certificates, and you or the vSphere administrator authorized access to this registry server by using the --insecure-registry option during VCH deployment.\n\nNOTE: In the examples, the Docker commands specify --tls. This is to specify that the connection between the Docker client and the VCH is secured by TLS. The level of security of the connection between the Docker client and the VCH is completely independent from the level of security of the connection between the VCH and the private registry server. The connection to the private registry server can be insecure when the connection between the client and the VCH is secure, and the reverse.\n"},"using_vic_with_harbor.html":{"url":"using_vic_with_harbor.html","title":"Using vSphere Integrated Containers Engine with vSphere Integrated Containers Registry (Harbor)","keywords":"","body":"Using vSphere Integrated Containers Engine with vSphere Integrated Containers Registry (Harbor)\nThis example illustrates using a deployed Virtual Container Host (VCH) with Harbor as a private registry with the assumption that a VCH has been set up using either static IP or FQDN.

To create bridge networks, use  network create.\nRun a container that is connected to two networks:\n docker run -it --net net1 --net net2 busybox\nRun containers that can each only reach one of the networks:\ndocker run -it --net net1 --name n1 busybox\ndocker run -it --net net2 --name n2 busybox\nRun a container that can reach both networks:\ndocker run -it --net net1 --net net2 --name n12 busybox\nResult\n\nn1 and n2 cannot communicate with each other\nn12 can communicate with both n1 and n2\n\nConnect Containers to External Networks\nConfigure two external networks in vSphere:\n\ndefault-external is 10.2.0.0/16 with gateway 10.2.0.1  \nvic-production is 208.91.3.0/24 with gateway 208.91.3.1  \n\nDeploy a VCH that uses the default network at 208.91.3.2 as its public network.\ndocker network ls shows:\n$ docker network ls\nNETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER\ne2113b821ead        none                null\n37470ed9992f        default-external    bridge\nea96a6b919de        vic-production      bridge\nb7e91524f3e2        bridge              bridge  \nYou have a container that provides a Web service to expose outside of the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine environment.\nOutput of docker network inspect default-external:\n[\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"default-external\",\n        \"Id\": \"id\",\n        \"Scope\": \"external\",\n        \"Driver\": \"bridge\",\n        \"IPAM\": {\n            \"Driver\": \"default\",\n            \"Options\": {},\n            \"Config\": [\n                {\n                    \"Subnet\": \"10.2.0.0/16\",\n                    \"Gateway\": \"10.2.0.1\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        \"Containers\": {},\n        \"Options\": {}\n    }\n]\nOutput of docker network inspect vic-production:\n[\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"vic-production\",\n        \"Id\": \"id\",\n        \"Scope\": \"external\",\n        \"Driver\": \"bridge\",\n        \"IPAM\": {\n            \"Driver\": \"default\",\n            \"Options\": {},\n            \"Config\": [\n                {\n                    \"Subnet\": \"208.91.3.0/24\",\n                    \"Gateway\": \"208.91.3.1\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        \"Containers\": {},\n        \"Options\": {}\n    }\n]\nSet up a server on the vic-production network:\n$ docker run -d --expose=80 --net=vic-production --name server my_webapp\n$ docker inspect \n  --format='{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' \n  server\n208.91.3.2\n$ telnet 208.91.3.2 80\nTrying 208.91.3.2...\nConnected to 208.91.3.2.\nEscape character is '^]'.\nGET /\n\nHello world!Connection closed by foreign host.\nNOTE: You can also use -p 80 or -p 80:80 instead of\n--expose=80. If you try to map to different ports with -p, you get a configuration error.\nResult\nThe server container port is exposed on the external vic-production network.\nDeploy Containers That Use Multiple Container Networks\nCreate multiple container networks by using vic-machine create --container-network. \nNOTE: The networks known as container networks in vSphere Integrated Containers Engine terminology correspond to external networks in Docker terminology.\nExample:\n./vic-machine-darwin create --target 172.16.252.131 --image-store datastore1 --name vic-demo --user root --password 'Vmware!23' --compute-resource /ha-datacenter/host/*/Resources --container-network pg1:pg1 --container-network pg2:pg2 --container-network pg3:pg3\npg1-3 are port groups on the ESX Server that are now mapped into docker network ls.\n$ docker -H 172.16.252.150:2376 --tls network ls\nNETWORK ID   NAME   DRIVER\n903b61edec66 bridge bridge\n95a91e11b1a8 pg1    external\nab84ba2a326b pg2    external\n2df4101caac2 pg3    external\nIf a container is connected to a container network, the traffic to and from that network does not go through the VCH.\nYou also can create more bridge networks via the Docker API. These are all backed by the same port group as the default bridge, but those networks are isolated via IP address management.\nExample:\n$ docker -H 172.16.252.150:2376 --tls network create mike\n0848ee433797c746b466ffeb57581c301d8e96b7e82a4d524e0fa0222860ba44\n$ docker -H 172.16.252.150:2376 --tls network create bob\n316e34ff3b7b19501fe14982791ee139ce98e62d060203125c5dbdc8543ff641\n$ docker -H 172.16.252.150:2376 --tls network ls\nNETWORK ID   NAME   DRIVER\n316e34ff3b7b bob    bridge\n903b61edec66 bridge bridge\n0848ee433797 mike  bridge\n95a91e11b1a8 pg1    external\nab84ba2a326b pg2    external\n2df4101caac2 pg3    external\nResult\nYou can create containers with --net mike or --net pg1 and be on the correct network. With Docker you can combine them and attach multiple networks.\n"},"creating_containerized_app_with_vic.html":{"url":"creating_containerized_app_with_vic.html","title":"Creating a Containerized Application","keywords":"","body":"Creating a Containerized Application with vSphere Integrated Containers Engine\nThe topics in this section provides guidelines for container developers who want to use vSphere Integrated Containers Engine to develop and deploy a containerized application.

As a consequence, you must use regular Docker without vSphere Integrated Containers Engine to build a container image and to push it to the global hub or to your private registry server. \nSharing Configuration\nThis release of vSphere Integrated Containers Engine does not support  data volume sharing or docker copy. As a consequence, providing configuration to a containerized application has some constraints. \nAn example of a configuration is the configuration files for a Web server. To pass configuration to a container when using vSphere Integrated Containers Engine, you can use the following workaround:\n\nUse command line arguments or environment variables. \nAdd a script to the container image that ingests the command line argument or environment variable and passes the configuration to the contained application. \n\nA benefit of using environment variables to transfer configuration is the containerized application closely follows the popular 12-factor application model.\nSince vSphere Integrated Containers Engine does not support sharing volumes between containers, you have the following options for processes that must share files:\n\nBuild the files into the same image and run them in the same container.\nWhen containers are on the same network, add a script to the container that mounts an NFS share:\nRun the container with an NFS server that shares a data volume.\nMount the NFS share on the containers that need to share files.\n\n\n\n"},"build_app_with_vic.html":{"url":"build_app_with_vic.html","title":"Example of Building an Application with vSphere Integrated Containers Engine","keywords":"","body":"Example of Building an Application with vSphere Integrated Containers Engine\nThe example in this topic modifies the voting app by Docker to illustrate how to work around the constraints that the current version of vSphere Integrated Containers Engine imposes. For information about the constraints, see Constraints of Using vSphere Integrated Containers Engine to Build Applications. \nThis example focuses on how to modify the Docker Compose YML file from the voting app to make it work with vSphere Integrated Containers. It does not describe the general function or makeup of the voting app.  \nGetting Started\n\nClone the Docker voting app repository from https://github.com/docker/example-voting-app.\nOpen the YML file for the simple Docker voting app, docker-compose-simple.yml.\n\n\nversion: \"2\"\n\nservices:\n  vote:\n    build: ./vote\n    command: python app.py\n    volumes:\n     - ./vote:/app\n    ports:\n      - \"5000:80\"\n\n  redis:\n    image: redis:alpine\n    ports: [\"6379\"]\n\n  worker:\n    build: ./worker\n\n  db:\n    image: postgres:9.4\n\n  result:\n    build: ./result\n    command: nodemon --debug server.js\n    volumes:\n      - ./result:/app\n    ports:\n      - \"5001:80\"\n      - \"5858:5858\"\n\n\nThis compose file uses two features that this version of vSphere Integrated Containers does not support:\n\nThe docker build command\nMapping of local folders to container volumes \n\nTo allow the voting app to work with vSphere Integrated Containers, you must modify it to work around these constraints. \nModify the Application\nThis version of vSphere Integrated Containers Engine does not support the docker build, tag, push commands.
